# Event Detection based on Dockless Scooter Trips in Austin, Texas

Dockless scooters are a recent occurrence in cities and towns across the United States. There is still relatively little understanding in how they fit into the cities and towns they operate in. There are various benefits with this technology -- scooters are readily available, cheap, and fun to ride. They are also touted as a solution for the first-mile/last-mile problem, which is something even the most developed transit systems still struggle with. 

Nevertheless, scooters have seen a fair share of opposition and problems. One of the biggest concerns is that these scooters affect city operations. Scooters impair the orderliness and safety of streets and sidewalk. In Washington, DC, San Francisco, and Austin, local residents have been forced to accept the new way of transit. People say they often feel unsafe around people riding scooters and many report that they have multiple almost collisions with riders.  

The issue gets even more out-of-control when masses gather for an event. This had happened in Austin in 2018 during the SXSW festival when scooters became a fun and cheap way to travel to conference events. Thousands of scooters could be found in downtown Austin, many of them obstructed the sidewalks, roads, public and private spaces. Riders were mostly not wearing helmets, cruising at high speeds. Although the city did not announce that they had any issues with it, many residents complained. An issue of forecasting such events (and smaller ones) and tying scooter ridership arises.  

We try to answer the following questions in our research:
 ### Can significant social events in Austin be detected using dockless electric scooter data in a predictive manner? Can the demand for scooters be predicted during events like holiday, sporting events, and concerts? Can we come up with a model that incorporates exogenous variables such as location of tripâ€™s origin and trip duration to make predictions? 
 
This is a project done by Soham Mody and Timur Mukhtarov for the course Machine Learning for Cities as a part of our master's in urban data science at New York University.
